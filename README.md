# Introduction

Online movies/TV-Shows streaming platforms have become common nowadays. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Hotstar etc have provided their own platforms for streaming movies. They use state-of-the-art technologies and algorithms to recommend us movies according to our taste and viewing history. In this project, I have tried to analyse my own netflix account's data to understand how insights can be drawn from mere viewing history. 

# Data Sources
I have used my own netflix account data and apart from that, downloaded the external dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
# Purpose
I will be analysing the viewing history of netflix account to find some insights related to the TV-Shows and movies that have been watched.

### Packages used
**sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**
# Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed some analysis to better undertsand the data.

# Conclusion
So far, I have observed that:
1. we have watched a lot of TV-shows/movies during 2020. The reason is obvious, due to lockdown and covid-19 situation. 
2. We used a lot of netflix during the month of July and August. 
3. Big-Bang Theory has been one of the most watched TV-shows till now followed by Friends and Naruto.
4. In case of movies, we have watched comedy genre movies a lot followed by action movies.

I will be trying to do some more analysis based on other features like duration of movie, country of making etc.
